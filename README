# Spring-Mass System SVD Solver

This project implements a numerical solution for a spring-mass system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The code calculates equilibrium displacements, internal stresses, and elongations of a spring-mass system based on user-defined parameters.

## Description
The code calculates the displacements, internal forces, and elongations of a spring-mass system using the following steps:
1. Create matrices representing the system.
2. Calculate the stiffness matrix and force vector.
3. Solve for displacements using SVD.
4. Calculate elongations and internal forces.

The system supports different boundary conditions: `Fixed-Free` and `Fixed-Fixed`.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting parameters.
- Robust SVD implementation for matrix decomposition.
- Calculation of condition numbers to assess matrix stability.
- Support for various spring-mass configurations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
